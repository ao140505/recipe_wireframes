# Recipe Wireframes

These are the wireframes associated with a side project of mine. I'm working an a web app for storing recipes. I have the app started and deployed, but I was losing focus on the desired end state for the site; it was starting to feel like I was just bolting on new features. So, I started these wireframes to bring some focus back to the project and better plan things out.

I'm putting these wireframes together using [balsamiq] (http://http://www.balsamiq.com/) - which I really enjoy using so far.
